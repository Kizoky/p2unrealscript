	Msg[0]="A difficulty made by a sado-masochistic psychopath.\\n"
	Msg[1]="\\n"
	Msg[2]="Bystanders won't be kind enough to drop (most of) their weapons anymore, but they will drop ammo if you're lucky. "
	Msg[3]="Unlike POSTAL and Impossible, you won't get an infinite Bass Sniffer radar, and its 'Chompy' Plug-In is removed. Catnip duration is also reduced. "
	Msg[4]="The number of weapons you'll be able to carry is limited, and the maximum amount of ammunition is reduced by 50%. "
	Msg[5]="Special damage like dismemberment and close range shotgun headshots can kill you instantly, and if that all wasn't bad enough, there are also some other surprises along the way...\\n"
	Msg[6]="Only the true POSTAL veterans (or the most hardcore masochists) should attempt this insanely hard difficulty, and I'm not fucking kidding!"
